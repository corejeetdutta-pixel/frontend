7. Replacement Policy: 
o For CTC up to ₹20 lakhs: If a candidate resigns within 3 months, 
Core will provide one replacement at no additional cost. 
o For CTC above ₹20.01 lakhs: If the candidate resigns within 6 
months, Core will provide a replacement at no additional cost. 
o This clause does not apply if the candidate is removed for any reason 
other than misconduct.

valid. However, if the client terminates the candidate for reasons 
unrelated to misconduct, Core is not liable to provide a replacement. 

8. Payment is due post-joining, under all circumstances, as per Clause 6. 

9. Independence of Clauses: The payment and replacement clauses are 
mutually exclusive. Under no circumstances should payment be withheld 
once the candidate joins. 

10. Trial Employment: Core does not recognize trial employment. Once a 
candidate referred by Core joins the client organization, or any of its group 
companies — with or without a formal offer or appointment letter — they are 
deemed to have formally joined, and Core is entitled to its full fee. 

11. Resume Confidentiality: All resumes shared by Core are for the exclusive 
use of the client. These must be returned or securely stored. They must not 
be shared with group/associate companies, friends, or relatives without Core’s 
consent. Any such appointments will be chargeable as per Clauses 1–6. 

12. Deferred Joining or Hire: If a candidate referred by Core is not selected or 
does not join initially, but is hired by the client or any associated/group 
company within one year, Core will be entitled to its full consultancy 
charges as per Clauses 1–6. 

13. Validity & Termination: These terms are valid for one (1) year from the 
date of issue. Either party may terminate the agreement earlier by providing 
one month’s written notice.
