Process Terms, Inclusions, Exclusions, and Limitations 
Process Terms 

1. Mandate Receipt 
Core will initiate the search and sourcing process upon receiving a confirmed 
and complete requirement brief (indent) from the client.

2. Candidate Feedback 
Clients are expected to provide qualitative feedback on submitted profiles 
within 24 hours of receipt. This includes shortlisting status, areas of concern, 
or any updates in role specifications.

3. Interview Coordination 
Interview schedules must be shared with Core in writing by the HR team or 
the respective Hiring Manager for smooth coordination and tracking. 

4. Offer Intimation 
Once an offer is extended to a candidate referred by Core, the client is 
expected to inform us immediately via phone and/or email to ensure seamless 
closure and onboarding support. 

5. Payment Follow-up 
In line with our commercial terms, Core's Accounts Department will begin 
follow-ups on pending payments starting T+7 days from the due date of 
the invoice, if required. 

6. Process Alignment 
Should any part of this process deviate from the client’s internal hiring 
protocols, we request that this be communicated in advance to avoid 
misalignment or delays. 
Inclusions 
● Candidate Sourcing & Screening 
Core will identify and refer candidates based on the role specifications shared 
by the client.
● Communication & Coordination 
Coordination support for interviews and offers, including scheduling, 
candidate availability, and post-offer follow-ups. 
● Replacement Assurance 
As per our commercial terms, Core offers one-time replacement support 
under specified conditions in the event a candidate voluntarily resigns within 
the agreed timeframes. 
Exclusions 
● Candidate Performance Post-Joining 
Core’s involvement concludes upon the successful joining of a referred 
candidate. We do not assume responsibility for a candidate’s job 
performance, behavior, or decisions post-joining. 
● Recognition or Accountability 
While we strive to refer high-quality candidates, we neither seek recognition 
when they excel nor accept blame in cases where performance does not meet 
client expectations. Performance is influenced by multiple internal and 
organizational factors beyond Core’s control. 
Limitations 
● Scope of Replacement 

Our replacement commitment is intended for exceptional cases (e.g., 1 in 5 
placements) where a candidate resigns voluntarily within the agreed period. 
If a disproportionate number (e.g., 3 out of 5) of placed candidates exit 
within a short time frame, it is indicative of systemic issues within the client’s 
environment, culture, or role definition. In such cases, Core shall not be held 
responsible and the replacement clause will not apply. 
Engagement Model & Exclusivity 
Core does not operate on a contingency model, wherein a position is circulated 
among multiple recruitment agencies, each racing to close the mandate first. We do 
not subscribe to the “dog-eat-dog” approach where success is dependent on being 
faster rather than better. 
Instead, Core functions as a strategic search partner. We encourage clients to 
first exhaust all contingency-based options and approach us when conventional 
methods fail to deliver results. Unlike many retained firms, we do not charge an 
advance fee, nor do we demand premium pricing. However, we do request that all 
positions assigned to Core be worked on exclusively.
This exclusivity ensures that the time, effort, and investment made by Core into 
sourcing, screening, and coordinating are recognized and compensated fairly, 
even in the absence of upfront payment. Our commitment is to close every role 
entrusted to us — and in return, we seek the client’s commitment to treat us as a 
trusted, focused partner rather than just one of many vendors.
